You will become the best we can make you, you will be the protectors of Earth and all her colonies.
Your forefathers wisely set aside their compassion, steeled themselves for what needed to be done. I see now why they left you behind. You are weak... and gods must be strong.
They shall not grow old, as we who are left grow old.  Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.  At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them.
